# Project-TodoList-Bootstrap-jQuery
This project is a single webpage containing different list items and a text area to add custom tasks. It is a very user-friendly and user-interactive project that makes the work of a user a lot easier. 

The “Add” button lets the user add an object to the list.
The “Reset” button lets the user reset the task and it will not be added in the list.
If a user clicks on any item, it gets striked off and marked as done.
Using the “Sort” button, the done task gets to the bottom and the uncompleted task gets to the top.
The “Cleanup” button cleans up all the tasks which are completed from the list. 
When the user doesn't have anything written on the task box, all buttons get disabled.
